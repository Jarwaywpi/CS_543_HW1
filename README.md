Jarway's HW1 for CS543:

One difference:
For the 'b' function in drawMode, I set it to tapping instead of holding be for two reasons:
1. 'starting' is a instant-time and one-time move, not a state like holding.
2. Sepecifying holding should company with specifying what to do when release it.
3. Tapping doing this job much better.
